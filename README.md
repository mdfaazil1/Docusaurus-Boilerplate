# Docusaurus Boilerplate ðŸš€

Welcome to Docusaurus Boilerplate! Get started with your documentation website quickly and easily using Docusaurus.

## What is Docusaurus?

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a modern static website generator that makes it easy to build and maintain open source project websites and documentation. It's built using React and Markdown, providing a smooth developer experience and beautiful, fast-loading websites.

## Features of Docusaurus

âœ¨ Clean and professional design out-of-the-box  
âœ¨ Markdown-based content creation  
âœ¨ Easy-to-customize theme and styling  
âœ¨ Search functionality for quick navigation  
âœ¨ Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Start right away with an already created Docusaurus app

This repo contains the boilerplate of an already created Docusaurus app, allowing you to skip the initial setup and jump straight into customizing your documentation website. You can focus on adding your content and making it your own without spending time on the setup process.

## Tutorial included for new users

When you start the app, you'll find a helpful tutorial to guide you through the basics of Docusaurus and how to get started with your own documentation website. This tutorial can be a valuable resource for new users looking to leverage this boilerplate for their projects.

## Customization

You can easily customize the theme, add your content, and configure Docusaurus to suit your project's needs. Check out the Docusaurus documentation for more information.

## Mix Markdown with React components

Apart from Markdown files, you can also create React components in respective directories and import them into MDX files. This allows for more dynamic content creation and enhanced customization options for your documentation website.

## Packages added for easy use:

- **Material-UI** - Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design. The library includes an extensive set of intuitive customizability features. 

- **react-live** - This brings you the ability to render React components with editable source code and live preview.

- **react-split-pane** - This package allows you to create resizable split panes or panels in your documentation app.

- **react-awesome-reveal** - React Awesome Reveal offers a collection of animated reveal effects for elements. It allows you to add attention-grabbing animations, transitions, or effects to improve user engagement and visual appeal.

Will be adding other packages in time for creating beautiful yet creative sites using docusaurus.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docusaurus-boilerplate.git
```

### Installation

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
